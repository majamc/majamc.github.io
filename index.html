            <p>Everytime we're in person you make me so happy Willy. No one ever made me as happy as you do, no one can even compare. You make me feel so comfortable with you
                that I start acting weird and doing things I thought I would never be comfortable doing around anyone. You're my safe space, I hope I'm yours too. This summer was so magical and I truly
                am so greatful that you took me with you to Japan. It was so amazing every single day we spent together. Thank you for taking me to Universal Studios with you and going to Hollywood dream
                with me even though you were scared. I truly appreciate that you did it for me. I truly love you from the bottom of my heart baby
